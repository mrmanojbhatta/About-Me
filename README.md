# Manoj Bhatta - OSINT Expert from Nepal

## About Me
Hello! I am Manoj Bhatta from Ghodaghodi, Kailali, Nepal. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in B.Sc. in Computer Engineering (BICTE) at Ghodaghodi Multiple Campus. Although my formal education doesn't offer courses in OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence), I have self-taught myself by exploring resources on the darknet, Telegram, and other platforms, gaining advanced skills in OSINT.

I have successfully exposed hundreds of cybercriminals such as carders, scammers, blackmailers, and many more. Despite the lack of institutional support, I have built a strong network of connections with cyber police, OSINT experts, and various legal authorities in Nepal and beyond.

## Journey & Challenges
- I come from a Sanskrit background, but I transitioned to science in the 11th grade, choosing Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. However, I faced difficulties and failed in Physics and Mathematics in 12th, resulting in a one-year academic delay.
- During that lost year, I dedicated my time to developing a powerful OSINT network, interacting with cybersecurity professionals, law enforcement, and legal authorities. Despite facing financial struggles from being part of a middle-class family, I worked tirelessly to enhance my skills.

## OSINT Expertise
I am Nepal's first OSINT expert, working in a field that is not yet well-known in the country. Though I do not hold any official certifications (as I believe in skills over certificates), I have access to thousands of OSINT tools and possess a strong mindset built on experience and self-learning.

### What I Do:
- Expose Cybercriminals: I have identified and exposed hundreds of cybercriminals, from carders to blackmailers, contributing to cybersecurity and law enforcement.
- Cybercrime Investigations: I assist legal authorities and cybersecurity teams in tracking and exposing online threats and frauds.
- Networking: Over time, Iâ€™ve built an extensive network with cyber police, OSINT professionals, and other legal authorities.

## Tools & Skills
- Darknet Research: Learned advanced techniques through darknet forums and channels.
- Telegram OSINT: Active in OSINT communities on Telegram for real-time updates and tools.
- Thousands of OSINT Tools: I have access to a vast collection of OSINT tools for email tracing, social media intelligence, domain lookups, and much more.

## Vision & Goals
As Nepal's first OSINT expert, my mission is to raise awareness about OSINT in Nepal, provide my expertise to law enforcement, and build a future where cybersecurity is prioritized. I aim to empower the next generation of Nepali professionals in the field of open-source intelligence, creating an OSINT ecosystem in the country.
